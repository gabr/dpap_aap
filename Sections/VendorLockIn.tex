\section{Vendor Lock-In}

\subsection{Form \& Causes}
In general it is strong dependence on a particular vendor technology which makes difficult or expensive to switch to an other technology. This especially problem when using vendors technology which is not based on global or open standards \cite{c2comVendor}. Each vendor update or change make problems to continuously maintain system interoperability \cite{SurvivalGuide}.

One of causes of this anti-patter is selecting product basing on marketing or sales information instead of technology inspection. Selected product varies from published open system standards because there is no conformance process which leads need for deep in knowledge about the product. Also thigh coupling with vendor technology is always bad practice - avoiding of developing isolation layer \cite{SurvivalGuide}.

\subsection{Form \& Causes}
Stovepipe System Anti-Pattern occur within one system. Two definitions can be found:
\begin{itemize}
\item Term describes system developed to solve a specific problem and containing data that cannot be easily shared with other systems \cite{c2com}.
\item System where no abstraction layers are used to communicate between subsystem which results in situation where everything is connected with everything \cite{Virtual}.
\end{itemize}
The first one is more general and applies to all stovepipe anti-patterns in general.
The second one will be further discussed in next chapters.

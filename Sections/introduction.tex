\section{Introduction}
Good architecture is a critical factor in process of transforming high level models into actual implementation \cite{Nordic}. Unfortunately the engineering discipline of software architecture is relatively immature and there is even no official definition \cite{ArchitekturaWikiPl}.
SEI provides three types of software architecture definitions \cite{SEI}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modern definition
    \item Classic definitions
    \item Bibliographic definitions
\end{itemize}
